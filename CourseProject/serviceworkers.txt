Service Workers 

They do a lot of work behind the scenes

Make our application work offline ready even in the absence of internet connection.

They allow us to use most of the next generation features of modern web applications 
like push notifications,background synchronisation 

Service workers are also single threaded as they run in the background 
and they are decoupled from the html pages .It is registered under HTML page 
It has certain scope where it applies to (all pages of a domain)
Service workers live even after all the pages have been closed in your application. 
Service workers can listen to events emittted by the javascript code or raised from 
the DOM or by some other server via the web push notifications.

Sits there in background react to all kinds of incoming events like return cached 
results

Listenable Events in Service Workers

Fetch       Browser or Page related JS initiates a fetch (http request)
            We can react to that event using the service workers.Service workers
            trigger the events when the fetch request occurs which goes through 
            the service worker to the server and gets the data from the server.
            Native XMLHttpRequest and the axios requests dont trigger the fetch 
            events.Since most events go through the service workers, you can 
            manipulate them, block them and control and cache them 

Push notifications  Send from other server .These vendor service from the browser 
                    sender will send you the push notification to the client 
                    application running and can in Service Worker you can listen
                    to the incoming push request.Service workers are running in  
                    background 

Notification interaction        User interacts with displayed notification 
                                Service workers always run though the tab of
                                browser may not run though.

Background synchronisation      Suppose you issued a post request to store 
                                some data on server and the internet connection 
                                failed.In that case browsers with this feature 
                                will preserve the action that causes this side 
                                effect of posting data, and will initiate the action 
                                once the connection is restored and establishes the 
                                emission of event of Background Sync which the service 
                                worker can listen once the connection is restored.

                                That means the action is cached and once the connection 
                                is restored the action is dispatched/emitted and the service
                                worker can listen to the event then.

This is not the javascript code that we want to run but the background process.
