spa - Angular React Vue (fws rerender the dom all the time )

SPA powered by Javascript Highly reactive
only one HTML page is served by the server.

PWA collection of tech independent of whether the application is 
a single page application or not 

Uses a lot of Javascript and frameworks

Aims to have high reactivity 

Can work with multiple files as well as single page applications 

PWA concept can also be used on a single static page as well 

Progressive Enhancement************************

Progressively enhance the web application 

Existing Legacy web application (old tech,maybe needs to support very old 
browser)

Existing Modern Application Modern Technology, only needs to support 
modern browser 

Upcoming Project can be turned into a pwa 

Near Future

Add some features of PWA into an existing application.
Implement some core PWA features
Fully implement as PWA from right to start 

Future
Use Multiple PWA features 
Completely convert to PWA
